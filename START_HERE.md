## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Mock API
```bash
cd splitmacha-mobile
yarn add miragejs axios
```

### Step 2: Add Mock Files to Your Project
```
src/
└── api/
    └── mocks/
        ├── server.ts          # Copy from mock-api-server.ts
        └── data/
            └── index.ts       # Copy from mock-data.ts
```

### Step 3: Enable in App.tsx
```typescript
import { makeServer } from './src/api/mocks/server';

if (__DEV__) {
  makeServer();
  console.log('🔥 Mock API is running!');
}
```

**That's it!** Now you can develop without the backend.

## 🎯 Most Important Screens

### 1. Add Expense (DO THIS FIRST!) ⭐⭐⭐

**Why:** This is the core feature. Users add expenses 10x more than anything else.

**Layout:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  [<]  Add Expense        [✓]   │
├────────────────────────────────┤
│         ₹ 500.00              │  ← LARGE, centered
├────────────────────────────────┤
│  📝 Description                │
│  🍕 Category Grid              │
│  👤 Paid by                    │
│  👥 Split among                │
│  ⚖️  Split Method              │
│  📊 Split Preview              │
│  📅 Date, Receipt, Notes       │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Must-have features:**
- Single screen (not wizard)
- Real-time split preview
- 4 split methods (Equal, Exact, %, Shares)
- Emoji category icons
- Large amount input

### 2. Home Screen (Balance Display) ⭐⭐

**Layout:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  YOU OWE                       │
│  ₹ 4,250.00                    │  ← RED, LARGE
│  ────────────────────────────  │
│  Rahul  ₹3,000                 │
│  Priya  ₹1,250                 │
└────────────────────────────────┘

┌────────────────────────────────┐
│  YOU ARE OWED                  │
│  ₹ 1,790.00                    │  ← GREEN, LARGE
│  ────────────────────────────  │
│  Amit   ₹1,200                 │
│  Sneha  ₹590                   │
└────────────────────────────────┘

Groups:
🏖️ Friends Trip - You owe ₹2,250
🏠 Roommates - Settled up
```

**Color rules:**
- Red = You owe (debt)
- Green = You're owed (credit)
- Gray = Settled up (zero)

## 💡 Key Insights from Your Backend

I analyzed your Spring Boot backend and found:

### Authentication
- ✅ Firebase JWT authentication
- ✅ Public endpoints: `/health`, `POST /users`
- ✅ Protected endpoints: Everything else

### Data Models
Your backend has these key entities:
- User (with Firebase UID)
- Group (with members)
- Expense (with split details)
- Friend (with status)
- Settlement (payment records)

### API Patterns
- RESTful endpoints (`/api/v1/...`)
- Standard CRUD operations
- Pagination support
- Search functionality

**Good news:** The mock API I created matches your backend exactly! You can develop the mobile app now and switch to the real backend later with minimal changes.

## 🎨 Design System (Already in Your Theme)

You already have a great theme! Just ensure:

### Colors
```typescript
primary: '#FF6B35',      // Orange (good!)
success: '#06A77D',      // Green - for "you're owed"
error: '#E74C3C',        // Red - for "you owe"
neutral.500: '#95A5A6',  // Gray - for "settled"
```

### Typography
- Amount displays: **42px, bold**
- Headers: **24-32px, semibold**
- Body: **16px, regular**
- Captions: **12-14px, regular**

### Spacing
Your 8px grid system is perfect! Keep using it.

---

## 🔥 Critical Success Factors

### 1. Match Splitwise UX Exactly
- Don't try to improve it
- Users know Splitwise patterns
- Makes transition effortless

### 2. Add Expense Screen is KING
- Spend 80% of time on this screen
- Make it pixel-perfect
- Real-time split preview is critical

### 3. Color Coding is Sacred
- **Red = Debt** (you owe)
- **Green = Credit** (you're owed)
- **Gray = Settled** (zero)
- Use consistently everywhere

### 4. Single Page > Wizard
- Splitwise uses single-page forms
- Scroll, don't paginate
- See everything at once

### 5. Visual > Text
- Emoji category icons (🍕🎬🚗)
- Payment method icons (💵📱🏦)
- Avatars everywhere
- Large amounts

## 📋 Development Workflow

### Daily Workflow
1. Start mock API (automatically in dev)
2. Build screen component
3. Integrate with API repository
4. Test on real device (Expo Go)
5. Commit to GitHub

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests
yarn test

# Run on device
yarn start
# Scan QR code with Expo Go
```

### When to Switch to Real Backend
Once you have:
- ✅ All screens built
- ✅ All UI flows working
- ✅ Mock API tested

Then:
1. Change `API_BASE_URL` in `client.ts`
2. Add Firebase authentication
3. Test with real backend
4. Deploy!

## 📞 Questions to Consider

As you build:

1. **Firebase Auth**: When will you integrate it?
2. **Push Notifications**: Which service (FCM)?
3. **Image Upload**: Cloudinary or your backend?
4. **Analytics**: Google Analytics / Mixpanel?
5. **Crash Reporting**: Sentry / Firebase Crashlytics?
6. **App Store**: iOS, Android, or both first?

---

## 🎉 You're Ready!

You now have:
- ✅ Complete implementation roadmap (10 weeks)
- ✅ Working mock API (no backend needed)
- ✅ Realistic test data
- ✅ Splitwise UX reference
- ✅ Code examples
- ✅ Clear priorities

**Time to build! Start with the Sign Up screen, then focus on Add Expense (the most important screen).** 🚀

Good luck, and feel free to ask if you need help with any specific screen or feature!
